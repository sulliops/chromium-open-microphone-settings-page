# chromium-open-cache-page

This Chromium extension allows the built-in cache clearing page at `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData` to be opened with a single click from the extension's icon.

This extension uses code from [chrome-extension_open-local-file-link](https://github.com/tksugimoto/chrome-extension_open-local-file-link) by [@tksugimoto](https://github.com/tksugimoto) to enable links to local pages.
